# CSS Bootstrap Responsive Portfolio

Description

My motivation in creating this project was to showcase my ability to create a responsive layout using Bootstrap and their grid system. I also wanted show I could display responsive images and modify Bootstrap elements to personalize them to my own style. This was first time writing code completely from scratch without the supervision of my instructor. It was a difficult challenge, but extremely rewarding. Not only did I accoomplish my goals to create a responsive layout and images using Bootstrap, but now I have the basis of a portfolio to showcase my work! 
To create this Responsive Portfolio, I created HTML files for every page that would be included (Bio, Contact, Portfolio) as well as three CSS files: the reset.css file to "reset" all browser inconsistancies to a consistent baseline, the second css file is to create compatiabilty between my HTML file and Bootstrap, and the style.css file is to add my own personal flair to my webpage. 
I used many components from Bootstrap such as my Navigation bar and the form on my contact page, but these were edited to suit my specific needs. I used Bootstrap's grid system to layout my pages and also to create the responsive layout, so my site will look good on any size screen. I also made the images responsive as well, but they will not appear bigger than the size of the original file. 
One of the challenges I faced was trying to get the dropdown menu to function on the Navigation Bar. I could not figure out why this function would not work. Luckily my classmates showed me how to import the proper Javascript code from the Bootstrap website so it could function properly. I was able to learn more about Bootstrap and the way it functions by making this small mistake!
